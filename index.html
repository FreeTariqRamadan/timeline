								        <p><strong>Pre-trial detention</strong><br/><br/>
										The 2nd of February 2018, motivated by the extreme violence and the similitudes between the two testamonials given by the presumed victims who initialy denied knowing each other, the Judges sentence Tariq Ramadan to preventative detention. Ramadan will enter the Fleury-Merogis prison, ahead of his trial for the following reasons:<br/>
                                        - Risk of flight, although he voluntarily presented himself to the police.<br/>
                                        - Possible intimidation of witnesses, although he would be scrutinized by the police.<br/>
                                        - Risk of committing same offence again, thus denying him the presumption of innocence.<br/><br/>
                                        It is based on these concerns that Tariq Ramadan will be kept in isolation, in a prison wing reserved for high-profile detainees.

								        <p><strong>Conditions of isolation</strong><br/><br/>
										<a href="https://prison.eu.org/IMG/doc/E2_L_ISOLEMENT.doc" target="_blank">Isolation</a> is usually reserved for detainees that could suffer discrimination from the rest of the carceral population. A special wing of the prison is thus reserved for people belonging to minority groups based on sexuality, race, religion, social status, etc.<br/>
                                        Tariq Ramadan integrates this wing, but is reserved a special treatment with respect to his fellow inmates: <br/>
                                        - he is deprived of any human contact for an average of 23 hours per day.<br/>
                                        - For each of his displacement, the corridors and the different rooms must be cleared form other detainees and staff.<br/>
                                        - To ensure the minimum of human contact, he is always escorted in his displacements by heavily armed masked guards.<br/><br/>
                                        His isolation is thus akin to solitary confinement (French for "cellule disciplinaire"), which is usually reserved as a <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/IHRLC/Guantanamo_and_Its_Aftermath.pdf" target="_blank">punishment</a>
                                        for detainees.
                                        According to the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (<a href="https://www.ncchc.org/solitary-confinement" target="_blank">NCCHC</a>), “regardless of the term used, an individual who is deprived of meaningful contact with others is considered to be in solitary confinement”.
                                        Solitary confinement, according to the United Nations, is considered a practice of <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2011/10/392012-solitary-confinement-should-be-banned-most-cases-un-expert-says" target="_blank">torture</a>.

                                        Tariq Ramadan, is kept in isolation with solitary confinement-like conditions until today.<br/>

								        <p><strong>Contradicting medical expertise</strong><br/><br/>
										In a first medical expertise, Dr. Farid Mehareb, the prison’s chief doctor, initially affirmed that Ramadan’s precarious health condition was incompatible with detention.<br/>
                                        After acknowledging that the second counter neurological expertise was botched in less than 20 min, the judges agree to proceed with a third expertise.<br/>
                                        On April 18th, the third expertise, specifies that Tariq Ramadan’s health is compatible with detention <strong>as long as he is granted access to proper treatment</strong>.<br/>
                                        However, instead of his required daily physiotherapy sessions, Tariq can only benefit from three sessions per week. And given his current burdensome detention conditions, the sessions are often shortened and cancelled.<br/><br/>
                                        It is important to note that the fact of denying access to proper medical treatment to a patient, in itself, is tantamount to <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/regularsession/session22/a.hrc.22.53_english.pdf" target="_blank">torture</a>.

										Tariq’s brother, Hani Ramadan, learn on June 17th that his assets have been frozen for six months, according to the decree published in the official French government bulletin.<br/>
                                        Hani Ramadan denounces a <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/terrorism-allegations_french-government-freezes-assets-of-hani-ramadan/44201696" target="_blank">political posturing</a> against his family, since he does not have any assets in France; not even a bank account.<br/><br/>
                                            
                                        The bank initially refused to let the family open an account dedicated to Tariq's legal fees and prohibited money transfers labelled "Tariq Ramadan".

Other rumours, such as Tariq admitting having had sexual relations with some of the accusers, are still circulating. This time, however, the rumour was entertained by the <a href="https://lemuslimpost.com/tariq-ramadan-mis-examen-en-suisse.html" target="_blank">plaintiff’s lawyer</a> via the misuse of technical juristic terms.
